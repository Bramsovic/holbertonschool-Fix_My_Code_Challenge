## 📚 Project Overview

The **Fix My Code Challenge** is a series of exercises where you dive into existing codebases in multiple languages and correct the errors. This project is 100% optional, but it can significantly boost your project average if completed. It is designed to enhance your debugging skills and expose you to a wide range of programming languages and code structures.

## 🎯 Project Goals

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Quickly identify and fix bugs in existing code
- Work with multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Ruby, C)
- Improve your understanding of algorithms and data structures
- Strengthen your problem-solving skills

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**
- All files must end with a **new line**
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project directory is mandatory

### 📄 File Descriptions

- **0-fizzbuzz.py**  
  - Fix the FizzBuzz implementation to correctly print **"FizzBuzz"** for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

- **1-print_square.js**  
  - Correct the square printing logic to ensure the size matches the given input.

- **2-sort.rb**  
  - Fix the sorting algorithm to correctly order numbers and strings.

- **3-user.py**  
  - Resolve password validation logic to ensure accurate testing.

- **4-delete_dnodeint/**  
  - Fix the double linked list implementation in C to correctly handle node deletion.

## 📝 Tasks

1. **FizzBuzz (Python)**  
   - Fix the logic to correctly print **"FizzBuzz"** for multiples of **3** and **5**.

2. **Print Square (JavaScript)**  
   - Correct the square size issue for consistent output.

3. **Sort (Ruby)**  
   - Ensure numbers and strings are correctly sorted.

4. **User Password (Python)**  
   - Fix password validation to pass all tests.

5. **Double Linked List (C)**  
   - Correct node deletion logic for consistent list management.
